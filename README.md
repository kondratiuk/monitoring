Application is available on the public server Heroku: https://monitor2018.herokuapp.com/
Limitations there:
1. Initial web page loading might take some time (upto 1-3 mins) since Heroku account is free and starts on demand;
2. Update interval for Heroku version has been increased up to 7 sec due to low-performing free server hardware;
3. You might face with different performance on different browsers. If so, try to start from IE 11.
